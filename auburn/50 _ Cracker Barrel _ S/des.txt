I found a USB drive under the checkers board at cracker barrel. 
My friends told me not to plug it in but surely nothing bad is on it?

I found this file, but I can't seem to unlock it's secrets. 
Can you help me out?

Also.. once you think you've got it I think you should try to 
connect to challenges.auctf.com at port 30000 not sure what that means, 
but it written on the flash drive..
