A friend of mine told me that he has an encrypted leaked database somewhere on his server. 
He has been willing to give me a program to retrieve it, but he did not give me the password used to decrypt the database. 
Can you find it?

He also told me that his program was super safe, and that I would not be able to use my tools on it.
