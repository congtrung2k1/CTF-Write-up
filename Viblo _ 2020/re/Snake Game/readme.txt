I made this awesome game. Can you beat my 30 points highscore?

Note: this binary do not print out flag. Run snake-game along with assets folder.

- Hint: there're bad foods, there're good foods. Only good ones can guide you to flag
- Hint 2: focus to food coordinates generate func, it related to a flag-derived array
- Hint 3: When you found that 24 integers array, final step is XOR to reveal flag
